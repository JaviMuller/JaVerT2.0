File for adding incompatibilities from new dependency versions:

(Incompatible with JS_Parser):
	yojson >= 2.0.0:
		Reason: Removed deprecated json type aliasing type t which has been available since 1.6.0
		Solution: Change json type by t type
		Latest Compatible Version: 1.7.0

(Incompatible with JaVerT2.0)
	ocaml-containers >= 3.0
		Reason: Split the library into separate packages `containers`, `containers-data`, and `containers-thread`
		Solution: View Migration guide at https://ocaml.org/p/containers-data/3.0
		Latest Compatible Version: 2.8.1

	(SOLVED) z3 != 4.8.5
		Reason: Inconsistent naming ('Z3' vs 'z3')
		Solution: Change name of dependencies for 'z3' (only?)
		Compatible Version: Z3.4.8.4
	
	OCaml >= 4.07.0
		Reason: Alert deprecated: module Stdlib.Pervasives. Use Stdlib instead.
		Solution: Add stdlib-shims to libraries, and replace all Pervasives.* calls by Stdlib.*
		Latest Compatible Version 4.06.1-1
